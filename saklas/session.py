        pair anchors both speakers in the same concrete situation drawn
        from _SCENARIO_BANK and asks each to embody one pole of the axis.
        Cross-pair variance is situational, within-pair variance is pure

        Speaker B embodies `baseline` — both poles are user-named.

        Monopolar mode (no baseline): Speaker A embodies `concept`,
        Speaker B embodies its semantic opposite — the model auto-derives
        the opposite pole.  Used for concepts like `agentic`, `manipulative`

        still wants meaningful contrastive distance (the previous
