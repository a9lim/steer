# web/

Static dashboard mounted at `/` by default when `saklas serve` runs. Opt out with `--no-web`. Library callers using `create_app(..., web=False)` directly default-off — only the CLI presumes the casual-user UX.

## Layout

```
saklas/web/
  __init__.py        # public re-exports: register_web_routes, dist_path
  routes.py          # the actual mount logic + SPA fallback
  dist/              # COMMITTED build artifact, ships in the wheel
    index.html
    assets/index.css
    assets/saklas.js
```

The Svelte 5 + Vite source lives at the repo's `webui/` directory (peer of `saklas/`). `cd webui && npm run build` emits to `saklas/web/dist/` directly — no intermediate copy step. CI gating on source-vs-dist drift is wired but disabled by default in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` because the committed bundle is the source of truth.

## Mount

`register_web_routes(app)` mounts `/assets/*` on `StaticFiles` for the bundled CSS/JS, registers `GET /` to return `index.html`, and a catch-all `GET /{full_path:path}` that serves real files when present and falls back to `index.html` for SPA-owned routes. `server.create_app` registers the dashboard last so the catch-all doesn't shadow `/v1/*`, `/api/*`, `/saklas/v1/*`. CLI default is `web=True`; the library default is `web=False` so embedded API surfaces don't pick up the dashboard accidentally.

`dist_path()` resolves the bundled assets through `importlib.resources` so it works for both editable and wheel installs. `WebUINotBuilt` is raised on mount when the dist directory is empty — only fires in source-tree installs that haven't run `npm run build` yet.

## What the dashboard is

The dashboard is a mouse-first interpretability cockpit. Four concerns must be answerable at any moment without leaving the main view: what conversation branch am I on (loom sidebar + branch canvas), what am I telling the model (input + system prompt + sampling), how am I steering it (steering rack + recipe builder), and what is it doing internally (probe rack + per-token tinting + activation atlas + correlation + layer norms + ppl).

Per-token highlighting lives on the chat tokens themselves, driven by a single highlight-probe dropdown in the chat header with an optional two-stripe compare-two mode. It tints **live** as tokens stream — the WS `token` event's `scores` aggregate feeds the same `scoreToRgb` ramp the post-generation pass uses, so streaming and finalized tints match (and match the TUI). The v1.6 always-on per-token × per-layer × per-probe heatmap is gone; the deep drilldown is opt-in via clicking a single token (`token_drilldown` drawer).

## Wire protocol

The dashboard speaks the existing `/saklas/v1/*` native API plus web-focused routes:

1. **WS `/saklas/v1/sessions/{id}/stream`** — token + probe co-stream. When probes are loaded the `token` event carries `scores` (`dict[str, float]` — the magnitude-weighted `score_single_token` aggregate, the same value the TUI tints live tokens with; the webui's inline highlight reads this so live highlighting matches the post-generation pass) and `per_layer_scores` (`dict[str, dict[str, float]]`, string-keyed — the per-layer heatmap the token drilldown drawer consumes). `done` carries `per_token_probes` assembled from `session._last_per_token_scores`. Drives chat tinting + click-token drilldown.
2. **GET `/saklas/v1/sessions/{id}/correlation[?names=…]`** — N×N magnitude-weighted cosine matrix. Default pool unions registered steering vectors AND active probes (deduplicated by name). Drives the correlation drawer overlay.
3. **GET `/saklas/v1/sessions/{id}/vectors/{name}/diagnostics`** — 16-bucket layer-magnitude histogram + per-layer magnitudes + (optional) probe-quality metrics. Falls back to `session._monitor.profiles` when the name is a probe rather than a registered steering vector. Drives the layer-norms drawer overlay (and `saklas vector why` from the CLI).
4. **GET `/saklas/v1/packs`** — locally installed packs, JSON shape. Drives the vector picker and probe picker.
5. **GET `/saklas/v1/packs/search?q=…`** — HF Hub proxy. Drives the Pack drawer's search tab.
6. **POST `/saklas/v1/packs`** — install pack from HF coord or local folder.
7. **POST `/saklas/v1/sessions/{id}/vectors/merge`** — register a merged-expression vector.
8. **POST `/saklas/v1/sessions/{id}/vectors/clone`** — corpus-based clone, SSE progress branch on `Accept: text/event-stream`.
9. **POST `/saklas/v1/sessions/{id}/experiments/fan`** — alpha grid as loom siblings, JSON `RunSet` summary.
10. **Loom tree routes under `/saklas/v1/sessions/{id}/tree`** — full tree + active path GETs, navigate/edit/branch/delete/star/note/reset mutations, `edge_label`, `filter`, `diff`, `joint_logprobs`, and transcript export/import. These power the sidebar, branch canvas, node compare drawer, transcript drawer, and experiment fan navigation.

`traits/stream` remains the live per-token probe SSE. The old alpha-grid `/sweep` SSE route is gone.

**Alpha grids.** `SweepDrawer.svelte`, the standalone table view, the
TUI `/sweep` alias, and the server `/sweep` SSE route are gone. Alpha
grids now land as loom siblings through `/fan` in the TUI and
`POST /experiments/fan` on the native API.

Adding a panel: write the .svelte file, wire new state into the smallest matching module under `lib/stores/` (or `stores.svelte.ts` only for cross-cutting WS/tree/chat state), mount from App.svelte's grid, `npm run build`, commit the regenerated `saklas/web/dist/`. Adding a drawer: write the .svelte file under `drawers/`, add the name to the `DrawerName` union in `lib/types.ts` (and to `NARROW_DRAWERS` in App.svelte for forms/pickers), add a branch to App.svelte's drawer switch, re-export from `drawers/index.ts`, and add it to the matching category fly-out list in `WorkspaceRail.svelte` so users can reach it.

## Reactivity gotcha

Svelte 5's `$state` does NOT track plain `Map.set` / `Set.add` / inner-object property writes inside collections. Cross-component state collections in `stores.svelte.ts` use `SvelteMap` / `SvelteSet` from `svelte/reactivity`. Inner-object mutations (e.g. `e.alpha = 0.5`) on map values are still untracked, so every rack mutator reassigns via `entries.set(name, {...e, alpha})` — applies to vectorRack and probeRack alike.

`updateProbeFromScores` (driven by every WS `token` event) is the hot path that depends on this — bare `entry.current = val` would freeze probe sparklines at zero throughout a generation.

## Persistence

The server loom tree is authoritative. The browser keeps a first-paint cache of the latest `LoomTreeJSON` plus `highlightState` (target / compareTarget / compareTwo) in `localStorage` under `saklas.chat.v2.<model_id>`; v1 flat `ChatTurn[]` logs auto-migrate via `hydrateV1ChatAsLinearTree`. Saves are debounced via `$effect.root` ~250 ms after mutations so token streams don't beat the disk. Restored after `refreshSession()` in `bootstrap` so the storage key resolves, then reconciled against the server tree.

**Size budget toast.** `schedulePersist` measures `JSON.stringify(payload).length` against `_LOCALSTORAGE_SOFT_BUDGET = 5 MB` per Decision 18 in `docs/plans/loom.md`. Above the threshold, `pushToast` fires a once-per-session advisory suggesting transcript export + tree clear. Write isn't hard-stopped; `_sizeWarned` guards against re-firing on every subsequent save. `Toaster.svelte` is the host (bottom-right, TTL-dismissed), mounted alongside `StatusFooter` in `App.svelte`.

The old server-restart guard is gone. v2 cache hydration is only a temporary first-paint path; `refreshLoomTree()` overwrites it with the server state once the native tree endpoint responds.

`pendingIndex` is force-cleared on restore so an in-flight turn from a killed tab doesn't ghost the UI.

## Steering / probe pickers

`SteeringRack.svelte`'s one entry point is the primary `+ add steering` button (and the empty-state copy above it on first run); it opens `VectorPickerDrawer`. The old quick text field is gone — the expression block's `✎ edit` affordance is the expert paste-edit path.

`VectorPickerDrawer` is a categorized menu: `_SearchableConceptList.svelte` groups `GET /packs` rows into the seven fixed categories (`concepts.ts::categoryOf` matches a category-valued tag; misses land in "other"), and each row is framed as its bipolar axis — negative pole, an interactive `Slider`, positive pole, an α readout — so the user sets the strength *before* clicking `add`. Monopolar concepts (`agentic`, `manipulative`) render one pole and a `0…+1` slider. `concepts.ts::polesOf` splits the canonical name on `BIPOLAR_SEP`; `recommendedAlpha` reads the pack's `recommended_alpha` (default 0.5). Custom extraction is inlined as the drawer's last section — the same SSE `/extract` flow; a search query that matches no catalog row seeds the custom `name` field. `ProbePickerDrawer` reuses the shared list with `showStrength={false}` (a probe observes, it has no steering strength). The drawer's footer keeps `load from disk`.

The picker mirrors the TUI's `/steer 0.5 honest` ergonomics: the server's extract endpoint short-circuits to the cached profile when the model already has it, then `addVectorToRack` lands it at the row's α. Standalone `ExtractDrawer` is retired — the form inlines into the picker.

## Click semantics

Probe rows: clicking anywhere on the row body (not the ✕) toggles highlight selection — first click anchors the probe as the chat-token highlight target, click again on the same row to deselect. ✕ is `stopPropagation`'d so removal doesn't trip toggle on the way out. The row uses `role="button"` + `aria-pressed` so the toggle is keyboard-reachable (Enter/Space).

Chat tokens: every per-token span is clickable regardless of whether a highlight probe is selected — the click opens `token_drilldown` with `{turnIdx, tokenIdx, isThinking}`. The `isThinking` flag routes the drilldown to `turn.thinkingTokens` vs `turn.tokens` so clicks inside the thinking-collapsible body resolve to the right token row. With no highlight target, tokens render bare but the hover outline still gives a click affordance.

Vector strip projection picker: the `⋮` menu's "project onto (~)…" / "project orthogonal (|)…" entries open an inline modal at `--z-modal` (above drawers) — text input autofocuses, Enter confirms, Escape / click-outside / cancel cancel. Replaces the v1 `window.prompt`. Re-clicking the same operator with an existing projection clears it (no dialog).

## Input history (↑/↓ recall)

Shell-style history on the chat textarea. Every line submitted via `doSend` lands in `inputHistory.entries` through `pushInputHistory` (chat messages and slash commands alike); ↑/↓ in `Chat.svelte::onKeydown` call `navigateInputHistory(±1, currentInput)`. Edge-only multi-line policy: ↑ recalls only when the cursor sits on the first line (`shouldRecallUp`); ↓ goes forward only on the last line (`shouldRecallDown`) and is a no-op when no recall is in flight, so multi-line editing inside the draft isn't hijacked. First ↑ stashes the in-progress draft; ↓ past the newest entry restores it. `INPUT_HISTORY_MAX = 200` caps the ring. **In-memory only** — no `localStorage` persistence, matches the TUI's process-scoped shape and avoids leaking command lines to disk. Mirrors `saklas/tui/app.py::_history_navigate` / `_push_input_history` semantics; bash-style dedupe (collapses immediate repeats, preserves ping-pong).

## Auto-regen (replaces A/B in v2.3)

The standalone A/B button is gone — Decision 13's "Ctrl+A toggles auto-regen" landed end-to-end. The auto-regen toggle + mode picker (`unsteered` / `inverted` / `reseed` / `cool` / `hot` / `custom: <partial recipe>`) live in `Chat.svelte`'s ⋮ actions menu (the webui overhaul moved the conversation actions off the topbar). `mode="unsteered"` is bit-identical to the old A/B flow.

`Chat.svelte`'s `twoColumns` derived OR-folds `pinnedActive || autoRegenActive` — pin generalizes the right column and auto-regen drives it when nothing is pinned. The WS `done` handler in `stores.svelte.ts` branches by mode: `unsteered` → `_sendShadowGenerate(steeredIdx)` (legacy shadow path, untouched); any other override → `loomRegenerateActive(mode)` + auto-pin to the new sibling. `toggleAutoRegen` retroactively fires a shadow for the most recent assistant turn when flipped on with `mode === "unsteered"` (mirrors the old A/B retroactive fire).

The legacy A/B compare flow follows:

`abState.enabled` toggles two-column rendering. The shadow gen (unsteered) runs after the steered turn finishes via `_sendShadowGenerate(steeredIdx)`, which:

1. Builds a messages list from `chatLog.turns[0..steeredIdx-1]` via `_buildShadowMessages` — past steered assistant turns ride along as context, the trailing user turn is what the unsteered model responds to.
2. Sends `input: <messages list>` + `stateless: true` over the WS so the server's `prior=[]` (stateless) and the messages list is the *only* context — no contamination from server-side history.

Toggling A/B from off→on while the chat already has steered turns immediately fires a shadow for the most recent assistant turn that doesn't have an `abPair` (skipped if a generation is in flight — the `done` handler will fire its own shadow). This is the "play the conversation back to the unsteered agent" flow: previously A/B only worked when regenerating the first turn.

## Thinking semantics

The thinking checkbox is a strict binary. Initial `samplingState.thinking` is `false` (not legacy `null` "auto"). Both `sendGenerate` and `_sendShadowGenerate` send `thinking: samplingState.thinking ?? false` so any null write that leaked through still serialises as explicit-off — the previous null path could leak through to the chat-template `enable_thinking=null` ambiguity and have the model think anyway.

## Loom sidebar (v2.3)

`panels/loom/LoomSidebar.svelte` is the collapsible left panel. Tree rendering is a flat DFS at depth-indented rows so nested recursive components don't stack frames. Decoration ring on each `LoomNode` follows Decision 10: `ringFor(node)` reads `highlightState.target` × `node.aggregate_readings[target]` and returns a reading value clamped to [-1, 1]; null when no probe is selected. The ring is the visual cue for "which branches the highlight probe lights up on" — independent of the dead-branch dim (`.node.dead { opacity: 0.3 }`) and the filter dim (`.tree-row.filtered-out { opacity: 0.5 }`) per Decision 18's three-channel separation.

Esc inside the sidebar defocuses the active element (search input / context menu) rather than collapsing the panel — collapse is a topbar action only. Context menu covers all five core ops + decorations (star/note) + pin + select-for-compare + fan-out + compare-children (user nodes with ≥2 assistant children).

**Focus on open.** `onMount → tick → asideEl.focus()` so `j`/`k`/`h`/`l`/`Enter` work the instant the user opens the sidebar from the topbar — without it the panel mounts unfocused and keyboard nav silently no-ops until they click a node.

**Esc priority.** `App.svelte`'s global Esc handler is ordered open-loom-modal → drawer → stop-gen. Modal open → App returns without `preventDefault` so `LoomSidebar`'s own window-level Esc handler (`onWindowKey`) closes the modal (or its context menu). Drawer open → close drawer. Nothing open + gen active → `sendStop()`. The earlier order (stop-gen first) made Esc-during-stream-with-modal-open kill the stream instead of dismissing the modal — surprising for the n-way regen flow.

**Mutation error toasts.** Every `loomEdit` / `loomBranch` / `loomDelete` / `loomNavigate` / `loomStar` / `loomNote` / `loomRegenerateActive` / `loomRegenerateFromUser` failure routes through `_captureLoomError(op, e)` which writes to `loomTree.error` AND pushes an error toast via `pushToast`. The persistent `loomTree.error` banner only renders inside the sidebar's empty-state branch — for trees with nodes the toast is the only surface, so silent 409s on edit-during-gen / network drops are gone.

**Ambiguous prefix surfacing.** `resolveByPrefix(prefix)` (sidebar's navpicker modal + `TranscriptDrawer`'s export-anchor input) returns `{id, matches}`: a single unambiguous match populates `id`; multiple-prefix matches leave `id=null` and surface "ambiguous: N matches (01HZA8B2, 01HZA8B7, …)" inline rather than picking the first one in Map insertion order. Exact-id input short-circuits even when other ids share the prefix.

**Modal validation keeps modal open.** `ModalState.error: string` is set via `setModalError(message)` from each `commitModal` branch on validation failure (fanout missing vector / unparseable alpha grid, navpicker miss/ambiguous, search miss). The modal renders the message in a `.modal-error` band below the input and stays open; only successful commits call `closeModal()`. Earlier path silently dismissed on bad input, eating the user's keystrokes.

## NodeCompareDrawer real-token rendering (v2.3)

`drawers/NodeCompareDrawer.svelte` renders per-token spans by iterating `diff.per_token` directly — each entry carries `{a_text, b_text, a_index, b_index, reading_deltas}` from the server's real model tokenization, so reading-delta tooltips and cross-pane hover highlight (`hoveredAnchorIdx` ↔ `aligned?.a_index`) align exactly with token boundaries. The earlier word-split-via-`/(\s+)/` shape mis-indexed alignment maps; the whitespace split is retained only as a fallback for nodes loaded without tokens (transcripts). Multi-select renders N columns with per-pair diffs; cross-pane highlight is gated `diffIdx === 0` (B-vs-A only) since N>2 pairings don't fit one hover target.

## Out of scope (current)

- True multi-session switching (server URL-paths support it; the client still assumes `default`). `SessionAdminDrawer` can inspect the collection and set an in-memory bearer key, but it is not a full session router.
- Persistent credential management. The session/auth drawer keeps a bearer key only in memory for the current page session; it deliberately does not write API keys to `localStorage`.
- Mobile / touch-first responsive layout. Saklas is a desktop research tool; min-width 1280px.
- Combobox autocomplete on the projection-target picker — the modal takes a free-form name; no live name-completion against the loaded-vector list.
- Pagination on HF pack search (capped at 20 results).
