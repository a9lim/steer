# tui/

Textual frontend over `SaklasSession`. Three panels — left (vectors), center (chat), right (traits). 15 FPS poll loop.

## Files

- `app.py` — `SaklasApp`; UI state, `BINDINGS`, `on_key`, slash-command handlers, generation workers, polling.
- `commands.py` — slash-command registry (`SlashCommand` table + `dispatch`). Slash handling lives here, not in `app.py`'s dispatch.
- `chat_panel.py` — `ChatPanel`, `ChatInput`, `_AssistantMessage`, `_TurnRow`; per-token highlight markup.
- `vector_panel.py` — `LeftPanel`; `MAX_ALPHA = 1.0`.
- `trait_panel.py` — `TraitPanel`; probe list + WHY/LAYERS histogram.
- `loom_screen.py` / `loom_helpers.py` — full-screen loom navigator + formatting helpers.
- `utils.py` — `build_bar`, `BAR_WIDTH = 24` (every bar in the UI; `vector_panel.RIGHT_W` derives from it).

## app.py

Thin frontend. Owns local alpha/enabled/thinking state; builds `SamplingConfig` + `Steering` from UI state per call. Thinking defaults to whatever `supports_thinking(tokenizer)` reports; `Ctrl+T` toggles it.

The `_generate` worker is a thin wrapper over `session.generate_stream` — no direct reach into `_apply_steering` / `generate_steered` etc. It forwards tokens through an app-local `_ui_token_queue: SimpleQueue` with tagged messages (`("tok", …)`, `("finalize", …)`, `("error", …)`, `("done",)`). `_poll_generation` drains the queue; the worker's `finally` emits `("done",)` after session teardown.

Panel index constants: `_LEFT, _CHAT, _TRAIT = 0, 1, 2`.

## Slash commands

Registered in `commands.py::_build_registry`. `dispatch` validates the whitespace-token count against each entry's `min_args`/`max_args` and, for `interrupts=True` entries, defers via `_pending_action` + `session.stop()` when a generation is in flight.

- Steering: `/steer <expression>`, `/alpha <value> <name>`, `/unsteer <name|ns/>`.
- Probes: `/probe <concept|pos . neg|ns/>`, `/unprobe <name|ns/>`, `/extract <concept|pos . neg>` (cache-warm only — and the only path that creates a new bipolar concept from `<pos> <neg>`).
- Session: `/clear`, `/rewind`, `/regen [N] [mode]`, `/sys` (alias `/system`), `/temp`, `/top-p`, `/max`, `/seed [n|clear]`, `/save <name>`, `/load <name>`, `/export <path>`, `/model`, `/help`, `/exit` (alias `/quit`).
- Analysis: `/compare <a> [b]` — 1-arg ranks cosine vs all loaded profiles; 2-arg is a pairwise score.
- Loom: `/tree`, `/nav <prefix>`, `/edit <text>`, `/branch [text]`, `/del [yes]`, `/star`, `/note <text>`, `/path`, `/fan <vector> <alphas>`, `/prune <filter-expr>`, `/auto-regen [mode]`, `/diff <id1> <id2> [--full]` / `/diff --siblings`.

`/steer` and friends take a full steering expression parsed by `saklas.core.steering_expr.parse_expr` — bare poles resolve through `resolve_pole` (canonical name + sign flip for installed bipolars); variant suffixes (`:sae`, `:sae-<release>`) are grammar-native; projections (`a|b`, `a~b`) and triggers (`@after`, `@when:…`) are accepted. A bare term with no coefficient uses `DEFAULT_COEFF` (0.5). `/probe <name>` also seeds the highlight probe and turns highlighting on.

Namespace bulk forms (`/steer ns/`, `/probe ns/`, `/unsteer ns/`, `/unprobe ns/`): the trailing-slash form is caught by `_detect_namespace_selector` before the parser runs. Add-side enumerates `_all_concepts()` for the namespace and routes through `session._try_autoload_vector` (cache-hit only — no extraction). `/steer ns/` registers loaded concepts at `DEFAULT_ALPHA = 0.5` with `enabled=False`. Concepts with no tensor on disk get a one-line summary with a `pack refresh` hint.

## Keybindings

Chat-screen `BINDINGS` (`SaklasApp`): `Ctrl+Q` quit · `Backspace`/`Delete` remove vector · `Ctrl+A` A/B · `Esc` stop gen · `Ctrl+R` regen · `Ctrl+C` copy · `Ctrl+T` thinking · `Ctrl+S` sort · `Ctrl+Y` / `Ctrl+Shift+Y` highlight-mode cycle · `Ctrl+L` loom · `Ctrl+E` edit · `Ctrl+B` branch · `Ctrl+N` nav · `Ctrl+D` delete · `Ctrl+Enter` / `Alt+Enter` commit (no-gen send) · `[` `]` temp · `{` `}` top-p.

`Ctrl+Enter` and `Alt+Enter` are bound with `priority=True` so the chat input widget can't swallow them. `Alt+Enter` is the cross-terminal fallback — but on stock macOS Terminal.app and iTerm2 neither passes through without a config tweak: Terminal.app needs "Use Option as Meta key" enabled, iTerm2 needs the "Esc+" mode for the Option key. Modern terminals with the CSI-u / kitty keyboard protocol (Ghostty, Kitty, WezTerm) get both for free.

Most app-level `Ctrl+letter` shortcuts that collide with the `ChatInput` editor bindings (`Ctrl+A` → line-start, `Ctrl+C` → copy, `Ctrl+D` → delete-right, `Ctrl+E` → line-end, `Ctrl+Y` → redo) carry `priority=True` so the app shortcut wins when the input is focused. The non-colliding editor verbs TextArea ships with (`Ctrl+W` delete-word-left, `Ctrl+U` delete-to-line-start, `Ctrl+K` delete-to-line-end, `Ctrl+V`/`Ctrl+X`/`Ctrl+Z` clipboard + undo) keep working — nothing at the app layer claims them.

`on_key` handles the rest contextually. Input-focused: `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` switch panels; `↑`/`↓` recall input history (chat input only, *edge-only* — recall fires when the cursor sits on the first/last row of the multi-line buffer, otherwise the arrow falls through to TextArea's cursor nav). Panel-focused: `Tab` cycle panels, `↑`/`↓` nav within panel, `←`/`→` nudge alpha by `_ALPHA_STEP_FINE = 0.01`, `Shift+←`/`Shift+→` by `_ALPHA_STEP_COARSE = 0.1` (both clamp to `MAX_ALPHA`), `Enter` toggle vector. The shift-arrow variants live in `on_key`, not `BINDINGS`, because arrow handling is already context-gated.

Gotcha: `Ctrl+H` can never fire — terminals send `0x08`, which Textual hard-maps to `backspace` before binding resolution. Same byte collision hits `Ctrl+Shift+H` on terminals without shift reporting; this is why the highlight cycle is on `Ctrl+Y`.

## Highlight modes

Three-state cycle `{off → probe → surprise}` — `Ctrl+Y` forward, `Ctrl+Shift+Y` backward. There is no separate binary toggle and no `/surprise` command. The `probe` slot defers to whatever the trait panel has selected; with no probes loaded it's skipped and the cycle collapses to `{off ↔ surprise}`. Surprise mode is sentinelled by `chat_panel.SURPRISE_PROBE = "__surprise__"` on `_highlight_probe`. The active mode shows as the persistent `HL` line in the left panel's GENERATION block; `_apply_highlight_to_all` is the funnel that refreshes it.

Live probe scores stream only when probe highlighting is active (`_wants_live_probe_scores()`; surprise mode uses logprobs and returns false). Worker forwards `event.scores` through `_ui_token_queue`; `_poll_generation` calls `widget.append_token_score(...)`. Surprise mode tints by chosen-token logprob (`-logprob / (1 - logprob)`); the streaming `SamplingConfig`s set `logprobs=0` so `event.logprob` is populated. At finalize, canonical projected scores from `session.last_per_token_scores` overwrite live ones via `_finalize_widget_highlight`.

## Generation, prefill, interruption

Role-aware send: when the active loom node is a *user* turn, a typed message composes the assistant reply (answer-prefill) rather than a new user turn. `on_chat_panel_user_submitted` resolves `_prefill_target_node_id()` once at submit time and carries it in the `("submit", text, prefill_target)` pending tuple. Prefill routes to `_start_prefill` → `session.prefill_assistant`, streaming through the same `_ui_token_queue` (no live probe scores on this path). `chat_panel.set_prefill_mode(on)` flips the input placeholder; `_refresh_input_mode()` syncs it to the active node.

`chat_panel.on_input_submitted` does not mount the user row (it can't know the active-node role) — it just posts `UserSubmitted`; `on_chat_panel_user_submitted` mounts it for normal sends, skips it for prefills.

`Ctrl+Enter` / `Alt+Enter` is the commit (no-generation) path: `action_commit_text` reads the input value directly off the `#chat-input` widget, branches on `_prefill_target_node_id()` (user-role active node → `_start_commit_assistant` → `session.append_assistant_turn`; otherwise → `_start_commit_user` → `session.append_user_turn`), and mounts the row up front. Mid-gen commits queue behind via `_pending_action = ("commit_user", text)` or `("commit_assistant", text, user_node_id)`; `_dispatch_pending_action` handles both kinds. Commit workers don't stream — the row mounts finalized (via `chat_panel.add_finalized_assistant` for the assistant case, `add_user_message` for the user case) and the session method runs on a thread; on failure the optimistic row is removed and a system message is surfaced.

Any conflicting action (`Ctrl+R`, new message, modifying slash command) calls `session.stop()` and stashes on `_pending_action`; `_poll_generation` consumes the `("done",)` sentinel and runs `_dispatch_pending_action`.

`_generate_core` calls `session._check_user_send_target(parent_node_id)` before `tree.add_user_turn` to refuse anchoring a user turn under a user-role node. Regen paths pass `parent_node_id=<user.parent_id>` explicitly so dedup reuses the existing user node.

## A/B and auto-regen

`Ctrl+A` (`action_ab_compare`) toggles both `_ab_mode` (the two-column layout) and `_loom_auto_regen_on` together — A/B is the default mode of the general auto-regen modifier. The chat log paints two columns per turn via the `_TurnRow` Horizontal, whose shadow column is `display: none` until the panel carries `.ab-on`.

`/auto-regen [mode]` stores `_loom_auto_regen_on` + `_loom_auto_regen_mode`. Built-in modes (`unsteered` / `inverted` / `reseed` / `cool` / `hot`) stash as strings; `custom: <expression>` parses into a `Recipe` partial. After each primary steered `done`, `_poll_generation` routes by mode: `unsteered` → `_start_shadow_generation` (stateless unsteered rebuild via `_build_shadow_messages`); any other mode → `_fire_auto_regen` (`generate_stream(..., recipe_override=mode)`). Both stream into the shadow column under `is_shadow=True`.

## Loom screen (`loom_screen.py`)

Full-screen `Screen`, reached via `Ctrl+L` (and `Ctrl+E`/`Ctrl+B`/`Ctrl+N`/`Ctrl+D`). Layout: one-line `#loom-header`, a `Tree` (left, `2fr`) / scrollable `#loom-detail` Static (right, `3fr`) split, and a hand-rendered two-line `#loom-keyhint` Static — *not* Textual's `Footer`, whose theme-variable rendering collided with the app's ANSI theme.

Navigation is cursor-based: `↑↓`/`kj` move through every visible node, `←→`/`hl` fold-then-parent / unfold-then-first-child, `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` jump siblings, `g`/`G` first/active node, `Enter` activates + returns to chat, `Space` activates and stays, `Esc` exits compare/help/filter then backs to chat. Mutations: `e` edit, `b` branch, `r` regen, `d` delete, `s` star, `a` note, `f` fan. Analysis: `c` flips the detail pane to turn-compare (`loom_helpers.format_compare` — diffs the assistant continuations of one user turn; the anchor is role-aware whether the cursor is on the user node or one of its replies), `/` search with `n`/`N`, `p` edit prune filter inline, `?` toggle keymap overlay.

Gotchas:
- `enter`/`space`/`tab`/`shift+tab`/`escape` are `priority=True` bindings — they'd otherwise be eaten by the focused `Tree` or Textual focus traversal. `check_action` disables all but `back` while a `_PromptOverlay` owns focus.
- `_PromptOverlay.on_mount` focuses its own input; querying for that input from `_open_overlay` races Textual's deferred mount.
- `_rebuild_tree` does a full rebuild on every mutation. Cursor re-seat is deferred via `call_after_refresh(self._finish_rebuild)` (inline re-seat races `Tree.clear`'s cursor reset). `_rebuilding` gates stray `NodeHighlighted` events during teardown; `_finish_rebuild` reads `_cursor_id` fresh so a keypress in the rebuild window isn't clobbered.

## Destructive-op confirm

`/del` requires `/del yes` to delete the active subtree; bare `/del` prints the hint. `Ctrl+D` routes through the same guard (`action_delete_subtree` → `_handle_del("")`) — no instant delete. The loom-screen `d` binding opens a `_PromptOverlay` requiring a typed `yes`. `_handle_del` pre-navigates to the parent before `delete_subtree` (the engine refuses to delete a subtree containing the active node) and surfaces the new active id. The loom-screen `d` flow operates on the cursor and does not pre-navigate.

## Persistence and chat repaint

`/save <name>` serializes the **entire** tree to `~/.saklas/conversations/<name>.json` via `LoomTree.save` (structure + text + recipes; per-token scores are not saved). `/load` reads it back, rewires the event bus + conflict hook, swaps into `session.tree`, resets monitor history, and repaints. There is no autosave. A model-id mismatch warns but does not refuse. (`saklas.core.transcript` YAML is unrelated — it backs the CLI `transcript run` verb only.)

`_repaint_chat_from_active_path` rebuilds the chat log to show only the loom tree's active path. Every navigation surface routes through it: `/nav`, `/load`, and loom-screen exit (`_return_to_chat`). Per-token probe scores aren't persisted on loom nodes, so navigated-to history renders without probe highlight; surprise highlight survives because logprobs ride along in node token rows. Loaded trees carry only `node.text` — plain finalized text.

`_AssistantMessage.set_static_content` populates a finalized message in one shot; it stashes the payload on `_pending_static` and applies it from `on_mount` because Textual mounts asynchronously. The highlight probe is seeded onto each widget before mount so navigated-to history comes up already tinted.

## Loom analysis commands

- `/fan <vector> <alphas>` — canonical alpha-grid sweep; routes through `session.generate_sweep`, reads sibling ids from the returned `RunSet.node_ids` so all siblings share one user-turn anchor.
- `/regen [N] [mode]` — N-way sibling regen; a trailing mode routes through `session.regen_with_modifier`.
- `/prune <filter-expr>` — parsed by `saklas.core.tree_filter.parse_filter`, stashed on `_loom_prune_expr`. `_rebuild_tree` dims non-matching nodes; both the loom footer and the chat status footer surface the active expression. Empty arg clears.
- `/diff <id1> <id2> [--full]` — ulid-prefix resolution (`resolve_node_prefix`), `session.diff_nodes`, word-level text diff + colored reading deltas. `/diff --siblings` diffs the active user-parent's assistant children.

## Panels

**Left panel** (`vector_panel.py::LeftPanel`): MODEL info, STEERING VECTORS, GENERATION block, KEYS reference. `_render_gen_config` is right-edge-aligned to `RIGHT_W = 11 + BAR_WIDTH + 4`: `Temp`/`Top-p` bars, then `Max`/`Think`/`Sys`/`HL` rows with trailing dim hint glyphs. The `HL` line is the persistent highlight-mode readout, set via `LeftPanel.update_highlight(mode)`, guarded against pre-mount calls.

**Trait panel** (`trait_panel.py`): two lines per probe — `> <name> <sparkline>` then `<bar> <val><arrow>`. Full untruncated names; `_nav_items` is `list[str]`. The bottom WHY footer (`#why-header`, set to literal `LAYERS` by `update_why`) shows `||baked||` per layer as a horizontal histogram bucketed into `HIST_BUCKETS = 16` groups (from `saklas.core.histogram`, shared with `cli vector why`). Driven by `_refresh_trait_why()` on trait nav / probe add-remove / finalize / clear / mount — not per streamed token. No `/why` command.

**Chat panel** (`chat_panel.py`): Markdown-free — user + assistant messages are plain `Static` widgets with Rich-escaped text. `_AssistantMessage` holds two content `Static`s (`#thinking-view`, `#response-view`) plus a `Collapsible` for thinking. Tokens escaped once on append. `append_token_score` adds live scores; `set_token_data` overwrites with canonical projected scores at finalize. Highlight saturation is fixed at `_HIGHLIGHT_SAT = 0.5`; zero scores get no background span. `_render_response` lstrips leading whitespace and `_build_highlight_markup` skips leading whitespace-only tokens (models emit `\n\n` after `</think>`). Thinking-block CSS zeroes Textual's `Collapsible` padding; transitions go through idempotent `ensure_thinking_collapsed()`.

**Chat input** (`ChatInput` in `chat_panel.py`): multi-line `TextArea` subclass. `Enter` submits via `ChatInput.Submitted` (re-posted by `ChatPanel.on_chat_input_submitted` as `ChatPanel.UserSubmitted`); `Shift+Enter` inserts a literal newline. Both behaviors live in an `_on_key` override — TextArea's default `_on_key` only treats bare `enter` as a newline insert, so `shift+enter` would otherwise be dropped. `placeholder` carries the modifier-hint cheat sheet. CSS sizes it `height: auto` with `min-height: 3`, `max-height: 10` so the buffer grows with content up to a soft cap.

## Status footer

`chat_panel.update_status`: one-line footer — dot + `gen_tokens/max_new_tokens` + progress bar (green while generating, dim between runs, `○ idle` before the first gen) · tok/s · elapsed · `ppl <mean>`. `prune_expr` and `auto_regen_mode` kwargs append `· filter:<expr>` / `· auto:<mode>`. Perplexity is the geometric mean of per-step `TokenEvent.perplexity` (`_log_ppl_sum` / `_ppl_count`, reset at `_start_generation`).

## Input history

Shell-style recall on the chat input. Every submitted line lands in `_input_history` via `_push_input_history` (readline-flavored — `A→B→A` records both, `A→A→A` collapses). Capped at `_INPUT_HISTORY_MAX = 200`. `↑`/`↓` call `_history_navigate(∓1)`; the first `↑` stashes the in-progress draft, `↓` past the newest restores it. In-memory, process-scoped. Implemented in `on_key`'s input-focused branch, gated on `focused.id == "chat-input"` so panel-side `↑`/`↓` (trait nav) keeps its meaning elsewhere.
