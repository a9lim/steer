# but transformers' ``LinearAttentionLayer.crop`` is a documented no-op
# — there is no sequence dimension to truncate on a recurrent state.
# That breaks ``cache_prefix`` correctness on hybrid models: after a
# generate, the LA state has been advanced through both prefix AND
# suffix tokens; the next reuse of the cached prefix would resume from
# a polluted state, silently producing wrong outputs.
#
# Fix: on prefix install, snapshot each LA layer's ``conv_states`` /
# ``recurrent_states`` (cheap — bounded-size tensors, kernel-sized conv
# state and ``(num_heads, head_dim, head_dim)`` recurrent state).  On
# ``crop``, restore from the snapshot in-place (preserving the

        This is the primary entry point for library users; it owns all the
        HF-loading heavy lifting. To wrap an already-loaded model use the
        plain ``__init__(model, tokenizer, ...)`` form.

        ``injection_mode`` selects the steering math: ``"angular"``
        (default, v2.1+) maps user α to a rotation angle; ``"additive"``
        is the legacy v1.x additive + norm-preserving path.  ``theta_max``
        sets the maximum rotation angle under angular mode (default π/2,
        i.e. α=1 fully aligns the residual with the concept direction).
        ``projection_metric`` selects the metric used when materializing
        ``~`` / ``|`` projection terms in steering expressions:
        ``"mahalanobis"`` (default since v2.1) uses the closed-form
        LEACE projector against the per-model whitener — provably erases
        linearly-decodable information along ``onto`` from ``base``;
        ``"euclidean"`` is plain Gram-Schmidt (the v2.0/v2.1 behavior).

        ``dls`` toggles the discriminative-layer-selection mask at
        extraction time (v2.1+).  When ``True`` (default), centered DLS
        per Dang & Ngo (2026) Eq. 9 drops layers where pos- and
        neg-class means project to the same side of the neutral
        baseline along ``d̂``.  Replaces the v2.0–v2.1 ``edge_drop``
        heuristic (gone in v2.1); ``--legacy`` flips this to ``False``.

        ``compile`` (default ``True``) auto-enables ``torch.compile`` on
        CUDA — kernel fusion via inductor, typically 1.2–1.5× decode
        tok/s on small models.  Auto-skipped on MPS/CPU.  Pass ``False``
        to debug architecture-specific compile issues; the angular hook
        scalars are tensor-pinned (v2.2) so a single compiled artifact
        survives α changes between generations.

        ``cuda_graphs`` (default ``True``, Phase B v2.2) auto-enables
        ``transformers.StaticCache`` + ``torch.compile(mode=
        "reduce-overhead")`` on CUDA-supported architectures.  Static
        K/V buffers across decode steps mean inductor can capture CUDA
        graphs internally — typical 1.5–2.5× decode tok/s on small
        models *on top of* the kernel-fusion win from ``compile=True``.
        Auto-skipped on MPS/CPU and on architectures whose StaticCache
        construction fails (probed at session init; the fallback reason
        is logged once).  Pass ``False`` to use DynamicCache (the v2.1
        path) — useful when debugging cache-related issues or when a
        specific architecture has subtle StaticCache quirks.

        ``compile_mode`` (default ``None`` → auto-select) overrides the
        torch.compile mode.  When None, the session picks
        ``"reduce-overhead"`` if ``cuda_graphs`` is on (paired with
        StaticCache for full graph capture) and ``"default"`` otherwise
        (kernel fusion only).  Pass an explicit value to force a
        specific mode regardless of the cuda_graphs decision.

        Thin delegate to :class:`saklas.core.extraction.ExtractionPipeline` —
        the pipeline owns folder probing, statement caching, scenario /
        pair generation, contrastive PCA invocation, and pack updates.
        Re-entry is gated against generation: extraction runs forward
        passes through the model and would race an active gen.

        **Default behavior**: tensor cache hits short-circuit.  On
        tensor miss, if ``statements.json`` exists (curated bundled
        pack or local cache), extract directly from it — statements
        are the expensive part and reuse is the sane default.  On
        statements miss, run the full pipeline: generate scenarios →
        generate pairs → save both → extract tensor.

        Flags:

        - ``scenarios=[...]``: explicit scenarios input; bypasses
          scenario generation and ``scenarios.json`` cache.  Written
          to disk after use.  **Also bypasses the tensor cache** —
          supplying fresh scenarios means the caller wants fresh
          pairs, so any cached tensor is stale by definition.
        - ``reuse_scenarios=True``: when regenerating pairs, load
          ``scenarios.json`` from disk if present instead of
          regenerating.  Default False — scenarios are cheap, so the
          full pipeline regenerates them fresh each pair-gen pass.
        - ``force_statements=True``: regenerate ``statements.json``
          from scratch.  **Also bypasses the tensor cache** — same
          reasoning as ``scenarios=[...]``.
        - ``method=None`` (default) inherits ``self._extraction_method``
          (set at session construction; ``"dim"`` unless ``--legacy``
          flipped it to ``"pca"``).  Explicit ``"dim"`` / ``"pca"``
          overrides per-call.
        - ``dls=None`` (default) inherits ``self._dls`` (set at session
          construction; ``True`` unless ``--legacy`` flipped it).
          Explicit ``True`` / ``False`` overrides per-call.

        Pre-v2.1 these defaults were hardcoded to ``method="dim"`` and
        ``dls=True`` regardless of session config — so ``--legacy``
        sessions calling bare ``session.extract(...)`` got the modern
        stack instead of the v2.0 one.  The ``None``-inherits-session
        shape closes that hole.

        ``injection_mode`` / ``theta_max`` / ``projection_metric`` are

        next outer scope (LIFO walk) and ultimately to the session-level
        default.  ``projection_metric`` doesn't drive hook rebuild on its
        own (projection materialization happens in ``steering()`` before
        ``__enter__``); it's recorded here for symmetry with the other
        two so :meth:`_resolve_steering_override` can answer "what
        metric does the active scope want?" uniformly.

        If ``_rebuild_steering_hooks`` raises (e.g. an unknown vector
        name hits ``VectorNotRegisteredError``) the just-pushed entry is
        rolled back before the exception propagates, so the stack is
        never left with stale half-committed state.

        Thread-safety: acquires :attr:`_gen_lock` (blocking) for the
        rebuild phase.  In-flight generations hold the lock for their
        whole forward+sample loop, so concurrent ``session.steering()
        .__enter__()`` from a different thread waits until the active
        generation finishes rather than mutating hook tensors mid-step.
        Single-threaded users (TUI, CLI) pay an uncontended acquire;
        the server's per-session asyncio lock serializes requests
        upstream so the contention path is exercised mostly by
        ad-hoc multi-threaded callers.

        Phase guard: rejects calls from the gen worker thread when
        :attr:`_gen_phase` is ``RUNNING`` or ``FINALIZING`` (i.e. an
        ``on_token`` callback re-entered the API mid-step).  RLock would
        otherwise let the same-thread caller pass straight through —
        the lock alone protects against cross-thread races, not
        callback reentry.  Legitimate same-thread callers reach

        Useful for batch workloads that re-issue the same chat-template
        head (system + leading user-instruction) hundreds of times — the
        v3 emotional run motivating this method does 800 stateless
        generations with the same kaomoji instruction prefix tokens.
        Per-call savings scale with prefix_len / total_input_len.

        Accepts:
        - ``list[dict[str, str]]``: encoded via ``build_chat_input`` with
          ``add_generation_prompt=False`` (the prefix should be the
          turn(s) that PRECEDE the assistant turn — generation-prompt
          tokens for the assistant turn are part of the per-call suffix).
        - ``torch.Tensor`` of shape ``[seq_len]`` or ``[1, seq_len]``:
          stored verbatim. Use this when the natural common prefix sits
          mid-content and isn't a clean message-list boundary (e.g. a
          fixed instruction concatenated into the user message before
          the variable prompt body).
        - ``None``: clear the cache. Equivalent to ``cache_prefix()``.

        Returns the cached prefix length in tokens (0 when clearing).

        Caveats (DOCUMENTED INLINE because they're easy to step on):
        1. Only safe to call OUTSIDE any active ``session.steering()``
           scope.  The prefix is prefilled with whatever steering hooks
           are live at call time — if those differ from the steering
           regime active at consume time, the cached hidden states are
           stale.  We invalidate the cache automatically on push/pop,
           but the call itself errors if a scope is open.
        2. Hidden-state capture is suspended for the duration of the
           prefill so the cached prefix doesn't pollute later score
           buckets.  No guarantees about what the monitor sees mid-call;
           callers shouldn't rely on probe state during cache_prefix.
        3. The cached tokens MUST appear as a byte-prefix of every
           ``generate()`` call's ``input_ids``.  If the caller's
           messages drift, the cache silently MISSES (cheap — full
           prefill on miss) but never silently MIS-HITS — the
           ``input_ids[..., :prefix_len].equal(prefix_tokens)`` check
           is exact.

                The session's config is never mutated by this call.
            stateless: do not mutate session history.
            raw: skip chat template, tokenize input string directly.
            thinking: per-call thinking override.  ``None`` = auto-detect
                via ``supports_thinking`` (or ``steering.thinking`` if set).
            on_token: optional callback ``(text, is_thinking, token_id,

                or ``sampling.return_top_k > 0``; ``None`` otherwise.
                ``perplexity`` is ``exp(entropy_nats)`` of the
                sampler distribution after temperature, top-k, and
                top-p renormalization.
            parent_node_id: loom-tree node id to anchor the new turn
                under.  ``None`` = active node (today's behavior).
            n: fan-out count.  ``n=1`` (default) returns a single
                :class:`GenerationResult`; ``n>1`` runs the same prompt

            wanting one stable shape are encouraged to wrap a single
            result in a list themselves rather than threading the

        ``generate_batch`` calls from interleaving — they queue FIFO at
        the per-call level, same as today's ``generate``.

        ``sweep`` maps ``concept_name → [alpha_0, alpha_1, ...]``.  The
        function generates one result per element of the product across
        every concept's alpha list.  For a single-concept sweep
        (``{"honest": [0.0, 0.3, 0.6]}``) you get three results; for
        ``{"honest": [-0.4, 0.0, 0.4], "warm": [0.0, 0.3]}`` you get
        six (3 × 2).

        Each generation runs under the steering expression
        ``base_steering + " + ".join(f"{α} {name}")``.  ``base_steering``
        defaults to ``None`` so the swept alphas are the only steering;
        pass a string to layer a fixed-alpha context underneath.

        ``on_result(idx, result, alpha_values)`` fires per completion.
        ``alpha_values`` is the ``{concept: alpha}`` dict that produced
        this row — recorded on each result's ``applied_steering`` too,
        but exposed here so SSE consumers don't have to re-parse the
        expression.

        ``return_node_ids`` toggles the legacy / current return shape.
        Explicit ``False`` is deprecated: in v2.4 this method will
        always return the ``(results, sibling_node_ids)`` tuple.
        Callers that need the bare list today should explicitly opt in
        via ``return_node_ids=False`` (this call) while updating to the
        tuple shape; callers that need only the ids should pass
        ``return_node_ids=True`` (the future-shape opt-in).  The
        sentinel default keeps today's bare-list return until v2.4
        flips it.

        Returns:
            When ``return_node_ids`` is unset or ``False`` (v2.3

            ``(results, sibling_node_ids)`` where ``sibling_node_ids[i]``
            is the assistant-node id finalized for ``results[i]`` (or
            ``None`` under ``stateless=True``).  Each result's
            ``applied_steering`` carries the canonical expression
