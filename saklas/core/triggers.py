"""Token-window triggers for selective steering activation.

A ``Trigger`` gates when a steering contribution fires during generation:
only during prompt prefill, only during response tokens, only within
thinking sections, only within the first/last N generated tokens, only
when a probe reading crosses a threshold, etc.  Attach one to a steering
entry (``Steering.alphas["name"] = (alpha, trigger)``) or at the
per-``Steering`` default (``Steering(..., trigger=Trigger.AFTER_THINKING)``).

Triggers compose at the hook layer: entries sharing a trigger pre-compose
into one tensor, distinct triggers get distinct tensors, and the hook sums
only those groups whose trigger is active at the current generation step.
The default ``Trigger.BOTH`` (steer every prompt + response + thinking
token) short-circuits the per-step ``.active()`` check.

**Probe gates (v2.2)**.  ``Trigger.gate`` carries an optional
:class:`ProbeGate` that consults the live monitor reading for a named
probe at the current generation step — e.g. "fire calm-steering only
when the angry probe reads above 0.4".  Probe scores are populated
into :class:`TriggerContext` per-step by the generation loop's score
callback (see ``saklas.core.generation.generate_steered``); when a
gate is present and the score isn't yet available (prefill, or
``probe_scores`` empty for any reason) the trigger reports inactive
— prefill gating on probe scores is meaningless.

``TriggerContext`` is a tiny mutable struct shared between the generation
loop and the hooks — the loop mutates it at lifecycle boundaries (prefill
→ decode, thinking transitions, per-step counter) and the hooks read it.
