#
# The same two invariances fall out of the baking step (they just moved
# from apply-time to extract-time):
#
#   - Layer-count invariance: total injection is independent of n_layers,
#     so models of different depths hit the same behavioral effect at the
#     same user alpha.  Without this, deeper models over-inject (e.g.
#     gemma-4-E4B at 42 layers vs gemma-4-31B at 60 layers would drift
#     by ~1.5× in coherent α).
#
#   - Score-magnitude invariance: absolute PCA scores vary wildly between
#     architectures (diffuse Llama-3.2-3B ≈0.07, sharp gemma-3-4b ≈0.25
#     for the same pairs), but only the *relative* per-layer shares
#     matter here — high-signal layers still get proportionally more
#     push within a profile.
#
# The gain is calibrated so that a user alpha of ~0.5 lands in the
# coherent steering band on the reference model (gemma-4-31B-it) for
# the bundled 21-probe pack.  Raising the gain shifts every model's
# coherent α lower; lowering does the opposite.  Smaller or non-standard-
# geometry models (MatFormer, MoE, heavily safety-trained) may still need
# proportionally higher alpha due to residual architectural effects
# (activation magnitude, attention layout) this normalization doesn't
# capture.
#
# Recalibrated from 3.5 → 2.0 when extract_contrastive gained the
# drop_edges=(2, 2) default.  Edge-drop removes L0/L1 and L_N-2/L_N-1
# from the share distribution (early layers carry tokenization/lexical
# features; late layers are unembedding-aligned — steering either corrupts
# surface form rather than latent meaning).  Remaining middle layers'
# shares inflate ~10-15% after redistribution, and the post-drop coherence
# ratio rises (directions align tighter), so per-α directional rotation
# increases.  2.0 pushes the cliff above α≈0.9 on the reference model,
# giving users a wide coherent band (~0.3-0.85) to dial in steering
# intensity and leaving generous headroom for the long tail of untested
# architectures.
