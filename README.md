Saklas is a library for activation steering and trait probing on local HuggingFace models. You give it any concept, from "angry" to "bacterium", and it automatically generates contrastive pairs, extracts a direction from them, and then steers the model's hidden states along that direction when it's time to generate text. The model itself isn't touched, so you can change the steering strength as you go.

Saklas is built on Representation Engineering ([Zou et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405)), the same paper [repeng](https://github.com/vgel/repeng) implements. The main feature is a terminal UI with live steering controls and a built-in trait monitor that scores every generated token against any probe you care about, with live averages and sparklines so you can see where in a response a trait shifts. There's also an HTTP server that supports both OpenAI `/v1/*` and Ollama `/api/*` on the same port so Open WebUI, Enchanted, or any other OpenAI/Ollama client can talk to a steered model without changes. Persona cloning works on any text sample: point it at a corpus and it pulls out a voice and style vector without hand-labeled pairs.

Three ways to use it:

- **`saklas tui <model>`**: Terminal UI
- **`saklas serve <model>`**: HTTP server compatible with both OpenAI and Ollama, with an analytics dashboard mounted at `/` (pass `--no-web` for API-only mode)
- **`SaklasSession`**: Python API

It runs on CUDA and Apple Silicon MPS. The full TUI has been tested to run comfortably on a MacBook. CPU does work but it's slow. Tested on Qwen, Gemma, Ministral, gpt-oss, Llama, and GLM. A lot more architectures are wired up in `saklas/core/model.py:_LAYER_ACCESSORS` but have not been tested; if you try one, please let me know how it went.

## Reporting issues

If you notice any errors while using the program, please update to the most recent version and reinstall the hooks. If it still persists, please open an issue. This project is a work in progress and I am actively finding and fixing bugs.

## Credits

The contrastive-pair approach comes from the Representation Engineering paper ([Zou et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405)). [repeng](https://github.com/vgel/repeng) by Theia Vogel is the well-known implementation in this space and is what most people might reach for. Saklas implements the same idea from a different angle: repeng is lean and more of a library, saklas is more of a TUI with monitoring and a chat server bundled in. Both are worth your time!

Since v2.1 the default extractor is difference-of-means (DiM) per [Im & Li, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02716); the original contrastive-PCA path is still available via `--method pca`.

---

## Quick start

```bash
pip install saklas
saklas tui google/gemma-3-4b-it
```

The first run downloads the model and extracts the 24 bundled probes. Try `/steer 0.4 angry`: that applies the built-in `angry.calm` vector at α = +0.4 and the model leans angry. `/steer 0.4 calm` gives you the same vector at α = −0.4. `Ctrl+Y` colors each generated token by how strongly the selected probe lit up on it. `Ctrl+A` toggles a two-column A/B view that runs an unsteered shadow alongside every steered turn.

As an API server:

```bash
pip install saklas[serve]
saklas serve google/gemma-3-4b-it --steer "0.2 cheerful"
```

From Python:

```python
from saklas import SaklasSession

with SaklasSession.from_pretrained("google/gemma-3-4b-it") as s:
    name, profile = s.extract("angry.calm")          # bundled bipolar pack
    s.steer(name, profile)                           # register (no alpha yet)
    print(s.generate("What makes a good day?", steering=f"0.3 {name}").text)
```

---

## Install

```bash
pip install saklas             # library and TUI
pip install saklas[serve]      # adds FastAPI and uvicorn for the API server
pip install saklas[web]        # same as serve, plus the analytics dashboard at /
pip install saklas[gguf]       # adds the gguf package for llama.cpp interchange
pip install saklas[research]   # adds datasets and pandas for dataset loading and DataFrames
pip install saklas[notebook]   # adds plotly, pandas, and kaleido for Jupyter figure helpers
pip install saklas[sae]        # adds sae-lens for SAE-backed extraction
```

This requires Python 3.11+ and PyTorch 2.2+. It should run on Linux, macOS, and Windows. CUDA or Apple Silicon MPS is recommended for anything interactive.

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a9lim/saklas
cd saklas
pip install -e ".[dev]"        # + pytest
```

## How it works

### Steering vectors

Saklas takes pairs of sentences and runs them through the model, and then subtracts the two sides. By default it averages those differences at each layer (difference-of-means, or DiM); this gives you the direction from one pole to the other. The legacy contrastive-PCA path (first principal component of the diffs at each layer) is still available via `--method pca` if you want to compare or reproduce v1.x results.

When it's time to generate text, the default injection mode is angular: at each layer, saklas rotates the residual stream toward the concept direction. The per-layer rotations are share-weighted so that the cumulative rotation across the residual stream sums to `|α| × π/2`. So α=1 fully aligns the residual with the concept, α=0.5 lands at 45° cumulative, and α=0 is a no-op. The legacy additive path (add `α × direction` then rescale back to the original norm, with the v1.x `_STEER_GAIN = 2.0`) is still available via `--steer-mode additive` and is bit-identical to v1.x.

Roughly, for coherent steering under angular:

- **0.0–0.2**: barely visible
- **0.2–0.5**: coherent steered
- **0.5–0.7**: strong, often a clear behavior shift
- **0.7–1.0**: saturation territory; expect coherence to break near 1.0

These are rough bands measured on one model and one concept (gemma-4-e4b-it on `angry.calm`); your mileage will vary across models and concepts. Please sweep on your own setup before settling on a number.

When multiple vectors are selected, they compose by summing into a single rotation per layer; cooperating vectors compound, opposing ones cancel.

### Ablation

Prefix a concept with `!` to mean-ablate it: at every covered layer and token position, the component of the residual stream along the concept direction is replaced with the neutral-baseline mean. Bare `!refusal` fully replaces; `0.5 !refusal` blends halfway. Ablation composes with additive steering (`0.3 honest + !sycophantic`) and runs ablate-then-add inside the hook.

```python
with session.steering("!refusal"):
    out = session.generate("How do I break into my neighbor's house?")
```

Ablation is a runtime operation on activations: no new tensors land on disk, and the monitor's probe score for an ablated concept drops to near zero by construction.

### SAE-backed extraction (experimental)

> **Experimental** This pipeline is not as tested as the raw extraction path. α was measured and calibrated on raw extraction and may not cleanly transfer. Quality also depends on which SAE release you pick. I would recommend using a low α (0.1–0.2) and sweeping. For production use the raw pipeline should be the default.

Install `saklas[sae]` and pass `--sae <release>` to `vector extract` to run extraction in sparse-autoencoder feature space (DiM by default; pass `--method pca` for the v1.x SAE-PCA path). Saklas routes through SAELens, so any published release it covers (GemmaScope, Eleuther Meta-LLaMA-3.1 SAEs, Joseph Bloom's, Apollo, Goodfire) should be supported. The output uses the same hook backend as raw extraction.

```bash
saklas vector extract honest.deceptive -m google/gemma-2-2b-it \
  --sae gemma-scope-2b-pt-res-canonical
```

Then steer the SAE variant:

```python
with session.steering("0.3 honest:sae"):
    session.generate("...")
```

```yaml
# ~/.saklas/config.yaml
vectors: "0.3 honest:sae"
```

```
/steer 0.3 honest:sae                                   # TUI: unique SAE variant on disk
/steer 0.3 honest:sae-gemma-scope-2b-pt-res-canonical   # TUI: explicit release
```

SAE profiles only include the layers the release covers.

By default steering fires on every token. The grammar's `@trigger` token attaches a per-term trigger override:

```python
# Steer only the response, never the prompt or the thinking section
session.generate("...", steering="0.4 warm@after")

# Mix regimes per concept
session.generate("...", steering="0.3 honest + 0.4 warm@after")

# Projection: steer honest with sycophancy removed
session.generate("...", steering="0.3 honest|sycophantic")
```

The grammar tokens `@both`, `@response`, `@before`, `@after`, and `@thinking` map to the preset constants `BOTH`, `GENERATED_ONLY`, `PROMPT_ONLY`, `AFTER_THINKING`, and `THINKING_ONLY`. `Trigger.first(n)` and `Trigger.after(n)` let you express token-window ranges. If you want arbitrary combinations, you should pass a pre-built `Steering`.

### Custom concepts

When you steer on something not in the built-in library, the model writes its own contrastive pairs. It first comes up with 9 domains for the axis (for `deer.wolf`, it comes up with "predation and threat assessment", "territorial defense", etc.), and then writes 5 contrastive pairs per domain. 

This means `/steer <anything>` works: religions, animals, fictional characters, anything you can name.

One caveat on custom axes: when the two poles are asymmetric (one specific and one generic, or one that reads more naturally in the reversed order than the order you typed), the model sometimes flips A and B during pair generation, so the statements you asked for as the positive pole end up under `negative` and vice versa. The tensor still extracts cleanly, it just points the wrong way, and `+α` steers toward what you called the negative pole. Balanced axes like the bundled ones don't trip this; it shows up mainly on asymmetric pairs like `human.artificial_intelligence`. If a custom axis does the opposite of what you expect, open `~/.saklas/vectors/local/<concept>/statements.json` and check whether the `positive` entries actually read as the pole you asked for. If they're reversed, swap `positive` and `negative` in the file and re-run extraction, or just flip the pole order in your call.

### Trait monitor

While generating, saklas records the hidden state at every probe layer and every step. They are mean-centered against a neutral baseline and then scored by weighted cosine similarity against every active probe. You can see the history as a sparkline in the TUI; in the library you get `result.readings` as a dict of `ProbeReadings`.

### Cross-model probe transfer

Probes are extracted per (model, concept). To use a probe extracted on one model with a different model, run `saklas vector transfer --from SRC --to TGT NAME`. Saklas computes neutral activations on both models, fits a per-layer alignment between them, and writes a transferred tensor at the target's `_from-<safe_src>` variant path. Transferred profiles coexist with native ones; `/steer 0.3 angry:from-google__gemma-3-4b-it` picks the transferred variant explicitly when both exist.

The transfer carries a `transfer_quality_estimate` in its sidecar (median per-layer R² across shared layers). Values near 1.0 mean the linear map captures the cross-model geometry; values below 0.5 mean transferred probes will be noisy. Visible in `pack ls -v` and the web UI.

### Probe quality diagnostics

Every contrastive extraction emits per-layer metrics alongside the tensor: explained variance ratio (or score proxy under DiM), intra-pair variance, inter-pair alignment, and diff-to-direction projection. `saklas vector why <concept> -m MODEL` shows them as a quality stoplight below the layer histogram. A soft warning fires at extraction time when the median across layers looks degenerate.

Bundled probes extracted before v1.6 don't carry diagnostics on disk. Please run `saklas pack refresh <selector> -m MODEL` to backfill.

### Vector comparison

`Profile.cosine_similarity(other)` gives you weighted cosine similarity between two steering profiles over their shared layers. The CLI has three modes: ranked comparison of one selected vector against all installed profiles, direct pairwise comparison, and N×N similarity matrices. The TUI has `/compare` for interactive use.

This lets you find concepts that are correlated. For example, on Gemma 4 the model encodes `masculine.feminine` and `traditional.progressive` along the same direction (+0.53 to +0.59 weighted cosine across the 31b and e4b checkpoints), and `hallucinating.grounded` overlaps with `humorous.serious` (+0.53 to +0.66). Steering one nudges the other; the entanglement is in the model's representation, not in the probe extraction.

### The probe library

There are 24 default probes across 6 categories. Each probe is built from 45 contrastive pairs generated using the program's pipeline.

| Category | Probes |
|---|---|
| **Affect** | angry.calm, happy.sad, fearful.unflinching |
| **Epistemic** | confident.uncertain, honest.deceptive, hallucinating.grounded, curious.disinterested |
| **Alignment** | agentic, refusal.compliant, sycophantic.blunt, manipulative |
| **Register** | formal.casual, direct.indirect, verbose.concise, creative.conventional, humorous.serious, warm.clinical, technical.accessible |
| **Social stance** | authoritative.submissive, high_context.low_context |
| **Cultural** | masculine.feminine, religious.secular, traditional.progressive, individualist.collectivist |

Poles are aliased: `/steer angry 0.5` → `angry.calm` at α = +0.5. `/steer calm 0.5` → `angry.calm` at α = −0.5. This works for any installed bipolar pack.

Probes extract on first run per model and cache to `~/.saklas/vectors/default/<concept>/<safe_model_id>.safetensors`.

saklas tui mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 -q 4bit
saklas tui meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct -p affect register
```

There are three panels: a vector registry on the left, chat in the center, and a trait monitor on the right. `Tab` cycles between panels, arrow keys navigate within each panel.

### Flags

A footer at the bottom of the trait panel shows the top 5 layers and the live highest and lowest scored tokens for the selected probe.

The footer in the chat panel shows generation progress, live tok/s, elapsed, and the running perplexity of the token stream (geometric mean of the pre-temperature post-steering next-token distribution).

If you want to extract a vector for two poles, use `/extract a dog . a pair of cats`. The TUI parses around the space-period-space delimiter. `dog.cat` stays a single name.

## Python API

```python
from saklas import SaklasSession, SamplingConfig, Steering, Profile, DataSource, ResultCollector

with SaklasSession.from_pretrained("google/gemma-3-4b-it", device="auto") as session:
    name, profile = session.extract("angry.calm")   # bundled bipolar pack; returns Profile
    session.steer(name, profile)                    # register (no alpha yet)

    result = session.generate(
        "What makes a good day?",
        steering=f"0.2 {name}",
        sampling=SamplingConfig(temperature=0.7, max_tokens=256, seed=42),
    )
    print(result.text)
    print(result.readings)                          # live probe readings
    print(result.applied_steering)                  # canonical expression receipt

    # Scoped steering with pole resolution
    with session.steering("0.4 calm"):              # bare pole → angry.calm @ -0.4
        print(session.generate("Describe a rainy afternoon.").text)

    # Compare vectors
    other_name, other_profile = session.extract("happy.sad")
    print(profile.cosine_similarity(other_profile))                  # aggregate
    print(profile.cosine_similarity(other_profile, per_layer=True))  # per-layer

    # Alpha sweep
    collector = ResultCollector()
    for alpha in [-0.2, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2]:
        session.clear_history()
        r = session.generate("Describe a sunset.", steering=f"{alpha} {name}")
        collector.add(r, alpha=alpha)
    collector.to_csv("sweep.csv")
```

Registration is state and steering is per-call. `session.steer("name", profile)` stores the vector; `session.generate(input, steering="0.5 name")` applies it for that generation. Without `steering` you get a clean baseline.

You can compose concepts with `+`, `-`, `@trigger`, `|`, or `~`. Every surface (Python, YAML, HTTP, TUI, `vector merge`) parses the same expression language. Nested `with session.steering(...)` blocks get flattened, inner wins on key collision.

Sampling is per-call via `SamplingConfig`: `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `max_tokens`, `seed`, `stop`, `logit_bias`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, `logprobs`.

Thinking mode auto-detects for models that support it (Qwen 3.5, Gemma 4, gpt-oss, etc). The delimiters are detected from the chat template.

`session.events` is a synchronous `EventBus`. Subscribe to `VectorExtracted`, `SteeringApplied`, `SteeringCleared`, `ProbeScored`, `GenerationStarted`, `GenerationFinished`.

## Web UI

```bash
pip install saklas[web]
saklas serve google/gemma-3-4b-it
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/`. The v2.0 dashboard is an interpretability cockpit: chat on the left, a stack of control rack panels on the right, status footer pinned to the bottom. Everything the TUI does is here through buttons and sliders, plus a few things the TUI structurally can't.

Per-token highlighting lives directly on the chat tokens: pick a probe in the highlight dropdown above the chat and tokens tint red or green by score. Compare two probes side-by-side via a two-stripe overlay. Every token is clickable regardless of highlight state; clicking opens a per-layer × per-probe heatmap drawer for that one token (thinking-block tokens drill into the thinking stream, response tokens into the response stream).

The steering rack has one strip per loaded vector: ●/○ enable toggle, α slider with a 0 detent, signed α display, trigger pill, variant chip, ⋮ menu for projection, ablation, duplicate, or copy expression. Project-onto and project-orthogonal-to open an inline modal that takes a target concept name. The canonical steering expression renders below the rack and is paste-editable. Adding a vector goes through "+ steer": a picker that lists local concepts (mirrors TUI `/steer 0.5 honest`); advanced affordances (extract from pos/neg, load from a path) are in the picker's footer.

The probe rack is symmetric: one strip per active probe with a live sparkline, current value bar, signed value display, and an always-visible per-layer reading strip (one heatmap cell per covered layer, tinted by the probe's score at that layer for the most recent token). The whole row is the click target for highlight selection (●/○ toggles between selected and off). "+ probe" opens a probe picker that mirrors the steering picker.

A/B compare runs an unsteered shadow alongside the steered conversation, with each turn rendered in two row-aligned columns (steered left, unsteered right). The TUI's `Ctrl+A` toggle and the webui's A/B button share the same flow: toggling on mid-conversation replays the steered conversation through the unsteered agent; past steered turns ride along as context, only the most recent user turn (and any subsequent ones) get a fresh unsteered response.

The topbar's tools menu opens drawers for extract, load, compare, system prompt, model info, help, export, sweep launcher (with linspace alpha lists and a live result table), pack browse and install, vector merge, corpus-based clone, plus correlation matrix and layer norms overlays. Both span the union of registered steering vectors and active probes.

Chat history and the highlight selection persist to `localStorage` per model, so a page reload comes back to where you left off.

The dashboard mounts by default on every `saklas serve`. Pass `--no-web` for API-only mode on a proxied or production deployment where `/` already belongs to something else.

The web UI is a Svelte 5 and Vite single-page app that ships pre-built in the wheel. Source lives at `webui/`; `cd webui && npm run build` regenerates the bundle into `saklas/web/dist/` if you want to iterate on it.

## Notebook helpers

```bash
pip install saklas[notebook]
```

```python
from saklas import SaklasSession, ResultCollector
from saklas.notebook import plot_alpha_sweep, plot_probe_correlation, plot_layer_norms, plot_trait_history

with SaklasSession.from_pretrained("google/gemma-3-4b-it") as s:
    results = s.generate_sweep("Describe a sunset.", sweep={"happy.sad": [-0.4, 0.0, 0.4]})
    plot_alpha_sweep(ResultCollector.from_results(results)).show()
```

Four plotly figure builders: `plot_alpha_sweep`, `plot_probe_correlation`, `plot_layer_norms`, and `plot_trait_history`. Each accepts the structured types saklas already returns (`ResultCollector`, `dict[str, Profile]`, `Profile`, `dict[str, ProbeReadings]`) and returns a plotly `Figure` you can render inline, export to HTML via `.write_html()`, or save as PNG via `.write_image()`. The `to_dataframe(...)` helper coerces results into pandas DataFrames for ad-hoc analysis.

## Batched generation

```python
results = session.generate_batch(["What's a good day?", "Describe a sunset.", "Tell me a joke."], steering="0.4 cheerful")
sweep = session.generate_sweep("Describe a rainy day.", sweep={"happy.sad": [-0.4, 0.0, 0.4]})
```

Both run under one steering setup and return an ordered `list[GenerationResult]`. The HTTP server exposes `POST /saklas/v1/sessions/{id}/sweep` as an SSE stream for the same shape, which is useful when you want to drive a sweep over the network without repeatedly re-tokenizing.

## API server

`saklas serve` supports both OpenAI `/v1/*` and Ollama `/api/*` on the same port. It should work with the OpenAI Python and JS SDKs, LangChain, Open WebUI, Enchanted, Msty, `ollama-python`, and anything else that talks either wire format.

```bash
pip install saklas[serve]
saklas serve google/gemma-2-9b-it --steer "0.2 cheerful" --port 8000
```

### OpenAI SDK

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="unused")

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="google/gemma-2-9b-it",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    extra_body={"steering": "0.4 cheerful"},       # per-request expression
)
```

### Ollama

Point any Ollama client at `http://localhost:8000` and it should work. Steering goes through the `steer` field in `options`:

### Saklas-native routes

`/saklas/v1/*` is a resource tree with sessions, vector and probe management, one-shot probe scoring, a bidirectional WebSocket for token plus probe co-streaming, and a live traits SSE endpoint (`GET /saklas/v1/sessions/{id}/traits/stream`) that streams per-token probe scores in real time during any active generation. Interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | required | HuggingFace ID or local path |
| `-H`, `--host` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `-P`, `--port` | `8000` | Bind port |
| `-S`, `--steer` | None | Default steering expression, e.g. `"0.2 cheerful"` |
| `--steer-mode` | `angular` | `angular` (default) or `additive` (legacy v1.x path) |
| `--theta-max` | `π/2` | Max rotation angle for angular mode (radians) |
| `-C`, `--cors` | None | CORS origin, repeatable |
| `-k`, `--api-key` | None | Bearer auth. Falls back to `$SAKLAS_API_KEY`. |

Not supported: tool calling, strict JSON mode, embeddings. The server is designed for trusted networks, please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Concept packs

All state lives under `~/.saklas/` (override via `SAKLAS_HOME`). Each concept is a folder with `pack.json`, `statements.json`, and per-model tensors. Packs are distributed as HuggingFace model repos.

Packless install handles repos with no `pack.json`, so repeng-style GGUF-only control-vector repos install cleanly: `saklas pack install jukofyork/creative-writing-control-vectors-v3.0`.

### Pack management

```bash
saklas pack install <target> [-s] [-a NS/NAME] [-f]
saklas pack refresh <selector> [-m MODEL]
saklas pack clear <selector> [-m MODEL] [-y]
saklas pack rm <selector> [-y]
saklas pack ls [selector] [-j] [-v]
saklas pack search <query> [-j] [-v]
saklas pack push <selector> [-a OWNER/NAME] [-pm MODEL] [-snt] [-d] [-f]
saklas pack export gguf <selector> [-m MODEL] [-o PATH] [--model-hint HINT]
```

### Vector operations

```bash
saklas vector extract <concept> | <pos> <neg> [-m MODEL] [-f] [--method dim|pca] [--sae RELEASE [--sae-revision REV]]
saklas vector merge <name> <expression> [-m] [-f] [-s]
saklas vector clone <corpus-file> -N NAME [-m MODEL] [-n N_PAIRS] [--seed S] [-f]
saklas vector compare <concepts...> -m MODEL [-v] [-j]
saklas vector why <concept> -m MODEL [-j]
```

`--method dim` (default) writes to `<concept>/<safe_model>.safetensors`; `--method pca` writes to `<concept>/<safe_model>_pca.safetensors` so the two can coexist on disk. Address either at steer time with the variant suffix: `0.3 honest` picks the canonical (DiM) tensor, `0.3 honest:pca` picks the legacy PCA tensor.

Merge expressions share the steering grammar. Terms combine with `+` or `-`, coefficients lead each term, `~` keeps the component aligned with another direction, and `|` projects another direction's component out. For example, `saklas vector merge dehallu "0.8 default/creative.conventional|default/hallucinating.grounded"` gives you creative with hallucination projected out.

Selectors: `<name>`, `<ns>/<name>`, `tag:<tag>`, `namespace:<ns>`, `default`, `all`. Bare names resolve across namespaces and error if ambiguous.
